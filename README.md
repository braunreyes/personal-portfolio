This README.md will serve as a "table of contents" for the publicly available work that I have done professionally and via trainings.

## Github Repositories

https://github.com/braunreyes/data-flows 

This is a fork of the self-service platform I designed and implemented for Mozilla - Pocket.

I implemented about 90% of what you see there.

This has great examples of:

- Workflow automation abstractions for self-service
- CI/CD for data applications
- Python development
- Ability to write and test data pipelines
- Ability configure and create cloud infrastructure to support data operations

https://github.com/braunreyes/netflix-data-pipeline-example

This is personal project to become familiar with how data engineering works at Netflix.

This has great examples of:

- Local environment creation from scratch using docker-compose
- Python development
- Ability to load data into Iceberg tables and model via dbt and Trino
- Ability to create test data using open source libraries.
- Ability to model kafka model data with Trino 

https://github.com/braunreyes/llm-training-project

This is a personal project created as part of a training on LLM tooling, specifically OpenAI and LangChain.
